# 2. API result access

Date: 2018-07-29

## Status

Done

## Context

We want to be able to use OLS Api results as objects (Ontology, Term, ...) instead of standard coreapi Document objects.
Coreapi API results are Document (a kind of OrderedDict in fact). making access to property annoying for programmer, 
having to know expected keys.

## Decision

To implement.

## Consequences

- [+] Ease data comprehension / retrieval
- [+] Ease API integration.
