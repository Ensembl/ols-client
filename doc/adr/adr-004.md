# ADR 004: Access list items as ArrayList i.e allow myList[1254] item retrieval

## TL;DR
We want to be able to use OLS client as follow:
```python

client = OlsClient()
terms = client.term('fpo', 'TERM_IRI')

term = terms[1254]

```  

## Context
Using this simplification implies that OlsClient.terms does calculate paging and everything hidden from OLS client user
