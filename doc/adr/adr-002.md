# ADR 002: Transformation of raw document results into kinda List Object

## TL;DR
We want to be able to loop simply over Ontologies / Terms results, without bothering if a
new call is made to change page.  

## Context
OLS API results are paginated, the page size is a parameter in Query.

There is no simple way to loop over all elements, and returning all results at once could hammer the service


## Decision
We will implement this with a `ListMixin` class, returned by service and loading sequencially all element in Highlevel object

## Status
Beta

## Consequences
* The list must keep track of current client, therfore if embed the actual client from initial request 
* ListMixin object are state-full.
