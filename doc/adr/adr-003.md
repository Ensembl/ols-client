# ADR 003: Transformation of raw document results into kinda List Object

## TL;DR
We want to be able to use OLS client as follow:
```python

client = OlsClient()
term = client.term('fpo', 'TERM_IRI')
ancestors = client.term.ancestors()
for ancestor in ancestors:
    print('do some stuff')

```  

## Context
Using this simplification implies that OlsClient.terms is stateful which might not be a good idea.

* A possibility is to create different client for Listing / Item retrieval

## Decision
No decision at the moment

## Status
To discuss

## Consequences
* Api client Objects become stateful and may loose SRP 
* If multiple objects for Unique item / listing, we keep SRP and stateless
