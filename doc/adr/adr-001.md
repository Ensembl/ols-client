# ADR 001: Transfer coreapi.Document into dedicated Objects

## TL;DR
We want to be able to use OLS Api results as concrete classes such as Ontology, Term.
  

## Context
Coreapi API results are Document (a kind of OrderedDict in fact). making access to property annoying for programmer, 
having to know expected keys. =


## Decision
We will create all destination classes, with standard mapping between expected keys and attributes. 
We add warning in case a key is encountered but not actually already defined in destination class. 

## Status
Accepted/Done

## Consequences
* This object are not standard coreapi.Document object which allow browsing HAL API 
* Browsing has to be managed at a upper level of abstraction, for instance inside associated API Client class.
